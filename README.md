# Decision Maker
The Decision Maker is a mini project I made to provide a solution for anyone struggling to make an easy decision (example: Movie to watch, food to eat, etc). This webpage stores the user's options in a array and randomly chooses from it using the Math.random(). This is for entertainment purposes only.
